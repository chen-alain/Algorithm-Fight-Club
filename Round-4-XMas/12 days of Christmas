On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me:
A Partridge in a Pear Tree

On the second day of Christmas my true love sent to me:
Two Turtle Doves,
And a Partridge in a Pear Tree

On the third day of Christmas
my true love sent to me:
Three French Hens,
Two Turtle Doves,
And a Partridge in a Pear Tree

.....
.....
.....

On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love sent to me:
Twelve Drummers Drumming,
Eleven Pipers Piping,
Ten Lords a Leaping,
Nine Ladies Dancing,
Eight Maids-a-Milking,
Seven Swans-a-Swimming,
Six Geese-a-Laying,
Five Golden Rings,
Four Calling Birds,
Three French Hens,
Two Turtle Doves,
And a Partridge in a Pear Tree
